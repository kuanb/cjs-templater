Dear Ms. Westover:

Director Human 

The above named defendant was released from the Salt Lake 

County Jail to our supervision.  We have maintained contact with 

the defendant and the Court regarding this case since that time.  

To our knowledge, no complaint has been filed.  On or about , we 

will notify the defendant that supervision by Pretrial Services will 

terminate.  We will also notify the defendant that charges may be 

filed at a later time.  If you prefer this supervision to continue, 

please contact me prior to the termination date.  Should your 

office choose to file this case later, please notify the defendant by 

summons.

Respectfully,

Case Manager
